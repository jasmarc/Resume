  {\large \textbf{Experience}}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \begin{tabular*}{7.5in}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}
      \textbf{Software Engineer}, Apple, Inc., Cupertino, CA & 10/2011 - Present\\
    \end{tabular*}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I work in Hardware Reliability. I work very closely with the development and manufacturing of new iThings from prototype to launch. We abuse Apple products in the name of science.
      \item I write software that performs automated stressing of hardware and then analyzes large volumes of aggregate data to search for reliability issues. Our findings inform and drive product development.

    \end{itemize}

    \item
    \begin{tabular*}{7.5in}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}
      \textbf{Software Engineer}, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Billerica, MA & 07/2011 - 10/2011\\
    \end{tabular*}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Okay, so there's this gun that you can point at an unknown thing like a piece of jewelry, for example. The pawn shop says it's solid gold, but you point your trusty ``tricorder" (yeah, like in Star Trek) at the ring and instantly the screen gives a full breakdown of the metallic compounds. Oh look, it's some sort of tungsten alloy. \emph{phew} We were almost duped. Glad we didn't waste our money on that.

      \item This is not science-fiction. This gun exists and I wrote embedded C++ in order to facilitate adding a GPS module to one of these guns.

    \item
    \begin{tabular*}{7.5in}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}
      \textbf{Software Engineer}, RSUI Group, Inc., Atlanta, GA & 10/2006 - 08/2010\\
    \end{tabular*}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I Wrote software that helped move RSUI, a commercial insurance company, towards becoming paperless.
      \item I Improved the productivity of RSUI's insurance professionals by facilitating the movement and storage of policy information.
    \end{itemize}

    \item
    \begin{tabular*}{7.5in}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}
      \textbf{Software Engineer}, Agentek, Inc., Atlanta, GA & 10/2004 - 10/2006\\
    \end{tabular*}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I Wrote embedded software for ruggedized mobile devices for various Fortune 500 companies in the trucking and field service industries to improve field data collection and distribution in areas such as routing and package delivery and confirmation.
      \item I Wrote a scripting language in C++ to facilitate the automatic provisioning and configuration of ruggedized mobile devices.
